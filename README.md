## #49 - Convert units using `Measurement<UnitType>`
üîÅ Starting from iOS 10 we can use [`Measurement`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/measurement) to convert units like e.g. angles, areas, durations, speeds, temperature, volume and [many many more](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/dimension).

Using e.g. `Measurement<UnitAngle>` we can refactor the computed property shown in note #48 to a method, that allows us to convert between any [`UnitAngle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/unitangle):

```swift
extension BinaryFloatingPoint {
    func converted(from fromUnit: UnitAngle, to toUnit: UnitAngle) -> Self {
        let selfAsDouble = Double(self)
        let convertedValueAsDouble = Measurement(value: selfAsDouble, unit: fromUnit)
            .converted(to: toUnit)
            .value

        return type(of: self).init(convertedValueAsDouble)
    }
}
```

Furthermore this approach leads to a very clean call side:

```swift
let cameraBearing: CLLocationDegrees = 180
cameraBearing.converted(from: .degrees, to: .radians)
```

## #48 - `FloatingPoint` - Protocol
üé≤ Ever needed an extension on all floating point datatypes, e.g. `Double`, `Float` or `CGFloat`? You can easily do this by extending the protocol `FloatingPoint`:

```swift 
extension FloatingPoint {
    var degToRad: Self {
        self * .pi / 180
    }
}

let double: Double = 90
let float: Float = 180
let cgFloat: CGFloat = 270

print("Double as radians", double.degToRad)
print("Float as radians", float.degToRad)
print("CGFloat as radians", cgFloat.degToRad)
```

## #47 - Wait for multiple async tasks to complete
‚è∞ Using a `DispatchGroup` we can wait for multiple async tasks to finish.

```swift
let dispatchGroup = DispatchGroup()
dispatchGroup.enter()
profileService.fetchProfile { profile in
    // ...
    dispatchGroup.leave()
}

dispatchGroup.enter()
profileService.fetchFriends { trips in
    // ...
    dispatchGroup.leave()
}

// We need to define the completion handler of our `DispatchGroup` with an unbalanced call to `enter()` and `leave()`,
// as otherwise it will be called immediately!
dispatchGroup.notify(queue: .main) {
  print("We've downloaded the user profile together with all friends!")
}
```

## 46 - Snapshot testing
üì∏ Snapshot tests are a very useful tool whenever you want to make sure your UI does not change unexpectedly. Using the library [SnapshotTesting](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing) from [Point-Free](https://github.com/pointfreeco) you can easily start testing snapshots of your `UIView`, `UIViewController`, `UIImage` or even `URLRequest`.

## 45 - Span subview to superview 
‚öìÔ∏è A small extension to span a subview to the anchors of its superview.

```swift
extension UIView {
    /// Adds layout constraints to top, bottom, leading and trailing anchors equal to superview.
    func fillToSuperview() {
        guard let superview = superview else { return }

        translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
            topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: superview.topAnchor),
            bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: superview.bottomAnchor),

            leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: superview.leadingAnchor),
            trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: superview.trailingAnchor),
        ])
    }
}
```

## 44 - Animate a view using a custom timing function
üöÄ Starting from iOS 10 we can use a `UIViewPropertyAnimator` to animates changes on views. Using the initializer `init(duration:timingParameters:)` we can pass a `UITimingCurveProvider`, which allows us to provide a custom timing function. You can find lots of these functions on [Easings.net](https://easings.net/). Using e.g. "[easeInBack](https://easings.net/#easeInBack)" your animation code could look like this:

```swift
extension UICubicTimingParameters {
    static let easeInBack = UICubicTimingParameters(controlPoint1: CGPoint(x: 0.6, y: -0.28),
                                                    controlPoint2: CGPoint(x: 0.735, y: 0.045))
}

class CustomTimingAnimationViewController: UIViewController {

    // ...

    func userDidTapButton() {
        let animator = UIViewPropertyAnimator(duration: 1.0,
                                              timingParameters: UICubicTimingParameters.easeInBack)

        animator.addAnimations {
            // Add your animation code here. E.g.:
            // `self.someConstraint?.isActive = false`
            // `self.someOtherConstraint?.isActive = true`
        }

        animator.startAnimation()
    }
}
```


## 43 - How to test a delegate protocol
üß™ Delegation is a common pattern whenever one object needs to communicate to another object (1:1 communication). In this gist I show you how to elegantly test a delegate-protocol from a view-model, by creating a mock and validate the invoked method(s) using an enum:
[Example on how to elegantly test a delegate protocol](https://gist.github.com/fxm90/106fd802f869d3d259d672d0416b66fa)


## 42 - Xcode multi-cursor editing
üèÉ‚Äç [Since Xcode 10](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode_release_notes/xcode_10_release_notes/source_editor_release_notes_for_xcode_10) the Source Editor supports multi-cursor editing, allowing you to quickly edit multiple ranges of code at once. You can place additional cursors with the mouse via:
```
shift + control + click
shift + control + ‚Üë
shift + control + ‚Üì
```


## 41 - Create a dynamic color for light- and dark mode
üé® Using the gist [UIColor+MakeDynamicColor.swift](https://gist.github.com/fxm90/fd217b463222afd6eabcb006fb26d92e) we can create a custom `UIColor`, that generates its color data dynamically based on the current `userInterfaceStyle`. Furthermore this method falls back to the `lightVariant` color for iOS versions prior to iOS 13.


## #40 - `UITableViewCell` extension that declares a static identifier
üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Using the extension below we can automatically register and dequeue table view cells. It prevents typos and declaring a static string on each cell.

```swift
extension UITableViewCell {
    static var identifier: String {
        return String(describing: self)
    }
}
```

Register a cell:
```swift
tableView.register(CustomTableViewCell.self, forCellReuseIdentifier: CustomTableViewCell.identifier)
```

Dequeue a cell:
```swift
let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: CustomTableViewCell.identifier)
```


## #39 - Prefer "for .. in .. where"-loop over `filter()` and `forach {}`
üé¢ In case you're iterating over a large array using a "for .. in .. where" loop is two times faster than combing `filter()` and `forach {}`, as it saves one iteration. So instead of writing:

```swift
scooterList
    .filter({ !$0.isBatteryEmpty })
    .forEach({ scooter in
        // Do something with each scooter, that still has some battery left.
    })
```

it's more efficient to write

```swift
for scooter in scooterList where !scooter.isBatteryEmpty {
    // Do something with each scooter, that still has some battery left.
}
```


## #38 - Lightweight observable implementation
üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ~~If you need a simple and lightweight observable implementation for e.g. UI bindings check out the following gist: [Observable.swift](https://gist.github.com/fxm90/26357043cfe174fabdeedd07d0f25314)~~

For re-usability reasons I've moved the code into a framework and released it as a CocoaPod. Please check out https://github.com/fxm90/LightweightObservable üôÇ


## #37 - Run test cases in playground
üß™ - Playgrounds are an easy way to try out simple ideas. It is a good approach to directly think about the corresponding test-cases for the idea or even start the implementation test driven.

By calling `MyTestCase.defaultTestSuite.run()` inside the playground we can run a test-case and later copy it into our project.

```swift
import Foundation
import XCTest

class MyTestCase: XCTestCase {

    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()
    }

    override func tearDown() {
        super.tearDown()
    }

    func testFooBarShouldNotBeEqual() {
        XCTAssertNotEqual("Foo", "Bar")
    }
}

MyTestCase.defaultTestSuite.run()
```
You can see the result of each test inside the debug area of the playground.


## #36 - Show progress of WKWebView in UIProgressBar
ü§ñ - In case you need to show the loading progress of a `WKWebView` on a `UIProgressBar`, please have a look at the sample code in the following gist: [WebViewExampleViewController.swift](https://gist.github.com/fxm90/50d6c73d07c4d9755981b9bb4c5ab931)

In the example, the `UIProgressBar` is attached to the bottom anchor of an `UINavigationBar` (see the method `setupProgressView()` for further layout details).


## #35 - Destructure tuples
üßô‚Äç Image having a tuple with the following properties: `(firstName: String, lastName: String)`. Using Swift we can destructure the tuple into two properties in just one line:

```swift
let (firstName, lastName) = accountService.fullName()

print(firstName)
print(lastName)
```

## #34 - Avoid huge if statements
‚ú® Instead of writing something like this:

```swift
struct HugeDataObject {
    let category: Int
    let subCategory: Int

    // Imagine lots of other properties, so we can't simply conform to `Equatable` ...
}

if hugeDataObject.category != previousDataObject.category || hugeDataObject.subCategory != previousDataObject.subCategory {
    // ...
}

```

We can split the long statement into several properties beforehand, to increase readability:

```swift
let isDifferentCategory = hugeDataObject.category != previousDataObject.category
let isDifferentSubCategory = hugeDataObject.subCategory != previousDataObject.subCategory

if isDifferentCategory || isDifferentSubCategory {
    // ...
}
```
Or use `guard` to do an early return:

```swift
let isDifferentCategory = hugeDataObject.category != previousDataObject.category
let isDifferentSubCategory = hugeDataObject.subCategory != previousDataObject.subCategory

let didChange = isDifferentCategory || isDifferentSubCategory
guard didChange else { return }
```

**Notice**: By using that pattern we do not skip further checks on failure (e.g. if we use `OR` in the statement and one condition returns `true` / we use `AND` in the statement and one condition returns `false`). So if you're having a load intensive method, it might be better to keep it as a single statement. Or, first check the "lighter" condition and then use an early return to prevent the load intensive method from being executed.

## #33 - Compare dates in test cases
üìÜ Small example on how to compare dates in tests.

```swift
func testDatesAreEqual() {
    // Given
    let dateA = Date()
    let dateB = Date()

    // When
    // ...

    // Then
    XCTAssertEqual(dateA.timeIntervalSince1970,
                   dateB.timeIntervalSince1970,
                   accuracy: 0.01)
}
```

## #32 - Be aware of the strong reference to the target of a timer
üîÅ Creating a timer with the method `scheduledTimer(timeInterval:target:selector:userInfo:repeats:)` always creates a **strong reference to the target** until the timer is invalidated. Therefore, an instance of the following class will never be deallocated:

```swift
class ClockViewModel {
    // MARK: - Private properties

    weak var timer: Timer?

    // MARK: - Initializer

    init(interval: TimeInterval = 1.0) {
        timer = Timer.scheduledTimer(timeInterval: interval,
                                     target: self,
                                     selector: #selector(timerDidFire),
                                     userInfo: nil,
                                     repeats: true)
    }

    deinit {
        print("This will never be called üôà")

        timer?.invalidate()
        timer = nil
    }

    // MARK: - Private methods

    @objc private func timerDidFire() {
        // Do something every x seconds here.
    }
}
```

But didn't we declare the variable `timer` as `weak`? So even though we have a strong reference from the timer to the view-model (via the target and selector), we should not have a retain cycle? Well that's true. The solution is mentioned in the [ documentation for the class "Timer"](https://apple.co/2yY9B1M)
> Timers work in conjunction with run loops. Run loops maintain strong references to their timers, so you don‚Äôt have to maintain your own strong reference to a timer after you have added it to a run loop.

and the [documentation for the method "timerWithTimeInterval"](https://apple.co/2CyIHB7)
> target: The timer maintains a strong reference to this object until it (the timer) is invalidated.

Therefore the run loop contains a strong reference to the view-model, as long as the timer is not invalidated. As we call `invalidate` inside the `deinit` of the view-model method, the timer gets never invalidated.

#### Workaround:
From iOS 10.0 we can use the method `scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval:repeats:block:)` instead and pass a `weak` reference to `self` in the closure, in order to prevent a retain cycle.

```swift
    init(interval: TimeInterval = 1.0) {
        timer = Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: interval, repeats: true, block: { [weak self] _ in
            self?.timerDidFire()
        })
    }
```

For iOS version below 10.0, we can use `DispatchSourceTimer` instead. There is a great article from [Daniel Galasko](https://twitter.com/danielgalasko) on how to do that: [A Background Repeating Timer in Swift](https://medium.com/@danielgalasko/a-background-repeating-timer-in-swift-412cecfd2ef9)

**Notice:**
Even for non repeating timers, you should be aware of that strong reference, cause the corresponding object won't get deallocated until the timer has fired.


## #31 - Initialize `DateFormatter` with formatting options
üöÄ Basic formatting, which requires only setting `dateStyle` and `timeStyle`, can be achieved with the class function [localizedString(from:dateStyle:timeStyle:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/dateformatter/1415241-localizedstring). 

In case you need further formatting options, the following extension allows you to directly initialize a `DateFormatter` with all available options:

```swift
extension DateFormatter {
    convenience init(configure: (DateFormatter) -> Void) {
        self.init()

        configure(self)
    }
}
```

Use it like this:

```swift
let dateFormatter = DateFormatter {
    $0.locale = .current
    $0.dateStyle = .long
    $0.timeStyle = .short
}
```
```swift
let dateFormatter = DateFormatter {
    $0.dateFormat = "E, d. MMMM"
}
```

Feel free to bring this extension to other formatters, like e.g. [DateComponentsFormatter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/datecomponentsformatter) or [DateIntervalFormatter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/dateintervalformatter), as well.

**Update:** Starting with Swift 4 we can use key-paths instead of closures:

```swift
protocol Builder {}

extension Builder where Self: AnyObject {
    func set<T>(_ keyPath: ReferenceWritableKeyPath<Self, T>, to value: T) -> Self {
        self[keyPath: keyPath] = value
        return self
    }
}

extension DateFormatter: Builder {}
extension NumberFormatter: Builder {}
```

Use it like this:

```swift
let dateFormatter = DateFormatter()
    .set(\.locale, to: .current)
    .set(\.dateStyle, to: .long)
    .set(\.timeStyle, to: .short)
```
```swift
let numberFormatter = NumberFormatter()
    .set(\.locale, to: .current)
    .set(\.numberStyle, to: .currency)
```

## #30 - Map latitude and longitude to X and Y on a coordinate system
üåç Not really an iOS specific topic but something to keep in mind üòÉ
> On a standard north facing map, latitude is represented by horizontal lines, which go up and down (North and South) the Y axis. It's easy to think that since they are horizontal lines, they would be on the x axis, but they are not.
> So similarly, the X axis is Longitude, as the values shift left to right (East and West) along the X axis. Confusing for the same reason since on a north facing map, these lines are vertical.

https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/68856

The following graphics illustrate the quote above:

| Latitude                                     |  Longitude                                      |
| :--------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------|
| [![Latitude][latitude--thumbnail]][latitude] | [![Longitude][longitude--thumbnail]][longitude] |

## #29 - Encapsulation
üö™ Always try to make as many properties and methods private as possible. Other classes don't not need know how a specific algorithm is implemented. Furthermore, this avoids side-effects due to unwanted changes on properties.
Did you know, that even notification receivers can be marked as private?

```swift
class KeyboardViewModel {
    // MARK: - Public properties

    /// Boolean flag, whether the keyboard is currently visible.
    /// We assume that this property has to be accessed from the view controller, therefore we allow public read-access.
    private(set) var isKeyboardVisible = false

    // MARK: - Initializer

    init(notificationCenter: NotificationCenter = .default) {
        notificationCenter.addObserver(self,
                                       selector: #selector(didReceiveUIKeyboardWillShowNotification),
                                       name: UIResponder.keyboardWillShowNotification,
                                       object: nil)

        notificationCenter.addObserver(self,
                                       selector: #selector(didReceiveUIKeyboardDidHideNotification),
                                       name: UIResponder.keyboardDidHideNotification,
                                       object: nil)
    }

    // MARK: - Private methods

    @objc private func didReceiveUIKeyboardWillShowNotification(_: Notification) {
        isKeyboardVisible = true
    }

    @objc private func didReceiveUIKeyboardDidHideNotification(_: Notification) {
        isKeyboardVisible = false
    }
}
```


## #28 - Remove `UITextView` default padding
‚Üî With the following code the default padding from an `UITextView` can be removed:

```swift
// This brings the left edge of the text to the left edge of the container
textView.textContainer.lineFragmentPadding = 0

// This causes the top of the text to align with the top of the container
textView.textContainerInset = .zero
```
Source: https://stackoverflow.com/a/18987810/3532505

The above code can also be applied inside the interface builder within the "User Defined Runtime Attributes" section. Just add the following lines there:

| Key Path                          | Type   | Value                                           |
| :---------------------------------|:-------| :-----------------------------------------------|
| textContainer.lineFragmentPadding | Number | 0                                               |
| textContainerInset                | Rect   | {{0, 0}, {0, 0}}                                |


## #27 - Name that color
üé® Not an iOS specific topic, but if your designer comes up with the 9th gray tone and you somehow need to find a proper name inside your code, check out this site: [Name That Color](http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/). It automatically generates a name for the given color üßô‚Äç


## #26 - Structure classes using `// MARK: -`
üîñ Using `// MARK:` we can add some additional information that is shown in the quick jump bar. Adding a dash the end (`// MARK: -`) causes a separation line to show up. Using this technique we can structure classes and make them easier to read.

```swift
class StructuredViewController: UIViewController {

    // MARK: - Types

    typealias CompletionHandler = (Bool) -> Void

    // MARK: - Outlets

    @IBOutlet private var submitButton: UIButton!

    // MARK: - Public properties

    var completionHandler: CompletionHandler?

    // MARK: - Private properties

    private let viewModel: StructuredViewModel

    // MARK: - Initializer

    override init(nibName nibNameOrNil: String?, bundle nibBundleOrNil: Bundle?) {
        viewModel = StructuredViewModel()

        // ...

        super.init(nibName: nibNameOrNil, bundle: nibBundleOrNil)
    }

    deinit {
        // ...
    }

    // MARK: - Public methods

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        // ...
    }

    // MARK: - Private methods

    private func setupSubmitButton() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

## #25 - Structure test cases
‚ö†Ô∏è Splitting test cases into `Given`, `When`, `Then` increases the readability and helps understanding complex tests.

 - In the `Given` phase we setup all preconditions for the test, e.g. configuring mock objects.
 - In the `When` phase we call the function we want to test.
 - In the `Then` phase we verify the actual results against our expected results using `XCTAssert` methods.

 #### Example:
```swift
class MapViewModelTestCase: XCTestCase {
    var locationServiceMock: LocationServiceMock!

    var viewModel: MapViewModel!
    var delegateMock: MapViewModelDelegateMock!

    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()

        // ...
    }

    override func tearDown() {
        // ...

        super.tearDown()
    }

    func testLocateUser() {
        // Given
        let userLocation = CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 12.34,
                                                  longitude: 56.78)

        locationServiceMock.userLocation = userLocation

        // When
        viewModel.locateUser()

        // Then
        XCTAssertEqual(delegateMock.focusedUserLocation.latitude, userLocation.latitude)
        XCTAssertEqual(delegateMock.focusedUserLocation.longitude, userLocation.longitude)
    }
}
```

## #24 - Avoid forced unwrapping
> The only time you should be using implicitly unwrapped optionals is with @IBOutlets.
> In every other case, it is better to use a non-optional or regular optional property.
> Yes, there are cases in which you can probably "guarantee" that the property will never be nil when used,
> but it is better to be safe and consistent. Similarly, don't use force unwraps.

Source: https://github.com/linkedin/swift-style-guide

Using the patterns shown underneath, we can easily unwrap optionals or use early return to stop further code executing, if an optional is `nil`.

```swift
if let value = value {
    // Do stuff with value here..
}
```

```swift
guard let value = value else {
    // Write a comment, why to exit here.
    return
}

// Do stuff with value here..
```


## #23 - Always check for possible dividing through zero
üí• Always make sure that a certain value is NOT zero before dividing through it.

```swift
class ImageViewController: UIViewController {

    // MARK: - Outlets

    @IBOutlet private var imageView: UIImageView!

    // MARK: - Private methods

    func someMethod() {
        let bounds = imageView.bounds
        guard bounds.height > 0 else {
            // Avoid diving through zero for calculating aspect ratio below.
            return
        }

        let aspectRatio = bounds.width / bounds.height
    }
}
```


## #22 - Animate `alpha` and update `isHidden` accordingly
ü¶ã Using the following Gist we can animate `alpha` and update the `isHidden` flag accordingly: [fxm90/UIView+AnimateAlpha.swift](https://gist.github.com/fxm90/723b5def31b46035cd92a641e3b184f6)


## #21 - Create custom notification
üìö For creating custom notifications we first should have a look on how to name them properly:

> [Name of associated class] + [Did | Will] + [UniquePartOfName] + Notification

Source: [Coding Guidelines for Cocoa](https://apple.co/2PPywfa)

Now we can create the new notification. We do this by extending the corresponding class:

```swift
extension Notification.Name {
    static let AccountServiceDidLoginUser = Notification.Name("AccountServiceDidLoginUserNotification")
}
```

And finally post it:

```swift
class AccountService {
    func login() {
        NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .AccountServiceDidLoginUser,
                                        object: self)
    }
}
```

For Objective-C support we further need to extend `NSNotification`:

```swift
@objc extension NSNotification {
    static let AccountServiceDidLoginUser = Notification.Name.AccountServiceDidLoginUser
}
```

Then, we can post it like this:

```
[NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter post:NSNotification.AccountServiceDidLoginUser
                                  object:self];
```

By extending `Notification.Name` we make sure our notification names are unique.

**Notice:** The object parameter should always contain the object, that is triggering the notification. If you need to pass custom data, use the `userInfo` parameter.


## #20 - Override `UIStatusBarStyle` the elegant way
‚úåÔ∏è Using `didSet` we can easily call `setNeedsStatusBarAppearanceUpdate()` to apply a new status-bar style:

```swift
class SomeViewController: UIViewController {

    // MARK: - Public properties

    override var preferredStatusBarStyle: UIStatusBarStyle {
        return customBarStyle
    }

    // MARK: - Private properties

    private var customBarStyle: UIStatusBarStyle = .default {
        didSet {
            setNeedsStatusBarAppearanceUpdate()
        }
    }
}
```

## 19 - Log extension on `String` using swift literal expressions
üëå Swift contains some special literals:

| Literal   | Type   | Value                                           |
| :---------|:-------| :-----------------------------------------------|
| #file     | String | The name of the file in which it appears.       |
| #line     | Int    | The line number on which it appears.            |
| #column   | Int    | The column number in which it begins.           |
| #function | String | The name of the declaration in which it appears.|
Source: [Swift.org - Expressions](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Expressions.html)

Especially with default parameters those expressions are really useful, as in that case the expression is evaluated at the call site.
We could use a [simple extension on String](https://gist.github.com/fxm90/08a187c5d6b365ce2305c194905e61c2) to create a basic logger:

```swift
"Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet üëã".log(level: .release)
```

That would create the following output:
> 2018/09/16 19:46:45.189 - ViewController.swift - viewDidLoad():15 - Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet üëã


## 18 - Use gitmoji
üòÉ Not an iOS specific topic, but I'd like to use [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) for my commit messages, e.g. `TICKET-NUMBER - ‚ôªÔ∏è :: Description` (Credits go to [Martin Knabbe](https://twitter.com/martin_knabbe) for that pattern). To easily create the corresponding emojis for the type of commit, you can use this [alfred workflow](https://github.com/ai0/alfred-gitmoji-workflow).


## #17 - Initialize a constant based on a condition
üëè A very readable way of initializing a constant after the declaration.

```swift
let startCoordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D
if let userCoordinate = userLocationService.userCoordinate, CLLocationCoordinate2DIsValid(userCoordinate) {
    startCoordinate = userCoordinate
} else {
    // We don't have a valid user location, so we fallback to Hamburg.
    startCoordinate = CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 53.5582447,
                                             longitude: 9.647645)
}
```

This way we can avoid using a variable and therefore prevent any mutation of `startCoordinate` in further code.


## #16 - Why `viewDidLoad` might be called before `init` has finished
‚ö°Ô∏è Be aware that the method `viewDidLoad` is being called immediately on accessing `self.view` in the initializer. This happens because that the view is not loaded yet, but the property `self.view` shouldn't return `nil`. Therefore the view controller will load the view directly and call the corresponding method `viewDidLoad` afterwards.

#### Example:
```swift
class ViewDidLoadBeforeInitViewController: UIViewController {
    // MARK: - Initializer

    override init(nibName nibNameOrNil: String?, bundle nibBundleOrNil: Bundle?) {
        super.init(nibName: nibNameOrNil, bundle: nibBundleOrNil)

        view.isHidden = true

        print("üìù :: `\(#function)` did finish!")
    }

    required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {
        super.init(coder: aDecoder)

        view.isHidden = true

        print("üìù :: `\(#function)` did finish!")
    }

    // MARK: - Public methods

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        print("üìù :: `\(#function)` did finish!")
    }
}
```

The code will output log statements in the following order:

```
üìù :: `viewDidLoad()` did finish.
üìù :: `init(nibName:bundle:)` did finish.
```

## #15 - Capture iOS Simulator video
üìπ A small tutorial on how create a video of what's happening in the simulator.

1. Run your App in the simulator
2. Open terminal
3. Run one of the following commands:
  *  To take a screenshot: `xcrun simctl io booted screenshot`
  *  To take a video: `xcrun simctl io booted recordVideo <filename>.<file extension>`
4. Press ctrl + c to stop recording the video.

For example:
```
xcrun simctl io booted recordVideo ~/appVideo.mp4
```

## #14 - Xcode open file in focused editor
üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Shortcuts are a great way to increase productivity. I often use `CMD[‚åò] + Shift[‚áß] + O` to quickly open a file or `CMD[‚åò]  + Shift[‚áß] +  J` to focus the current file in the project navigator etc.

> By default, when you ‚ÄòQuick Open‚Äô a file via cmd-shift-O, it opens in the ‚ÄòPrimary Editor‚Äô on the left ‚Äî even if the right editor pane is currently focused.
> Annoying.
> All I want to do is open two files side-by-side, switch between them easily, and have ‚ÄòQuick Open‚Äô target whichever side is currently focused.

[Jesse Squires - Improving the assistant editor](https://www.jessesquires.com/blog/xcode-tip-improving-assistant-editor/)

Jesse Squires provides a solution for that problem: By going to `Settings ¬ª Navigation ¬ª Navigation` and there checking `Uses Focused Editor`, we can tell Xcode to always open files in the currently focused pane.


## #13 - Handle optionals in test cases
‚úÖ Using `XCTUnwrap` we can safely unwrap optionals in test-cases. If the optional is nil, only the current test-case will fail, but the app won't crash and all other test-cases will continue to be executed.

In the example below, we initialize a view model with a list of bookings. Using the method `findBooking(byIdentifier:)` we search for a given booking. But as we might pass an invalid identifier, the response of the method is an optional booking object. Using `XCTUnwrap` we can easily unwrap the response.
```swift
class BookingViewModelTestCase: XCTestCase {
    func testFindBookingByIdentifierShouldReturnMockedBooking() throws {
        // Given
        let mockedBooking = Booking(identifier: 1)
        let viewModel = BookingViewModel(bookings: [mockedBooking])

        // When
        let fetchedBooking = try XCTUnwrap(
            viewModel.findBooking(byIdentifier: 1)
        )

        // Then
        XCTAssertEqual(fetchedBooking, mockedBooking)
    }
}
```

#### Prior to Xcode 11
[Require](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Require) is a simple, yet really useful framework for handling optionals in test cases (by John Sundell again üòÉ). He also wrote a great blog post explaining the use-case for this framework: [Avoiding force unwrapping in Swift unit tests](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/posts/avoiding-force-unwrapping-in-swift-unit-tests)


## #12 - Safe access to an element at index
‚õë Using the underneath shown range operator, we can easily create an extension to safely return an array element at the specified index, or `nil` if the index is outside the bounds.

```swift
extension Array {
    subscript(safe index: Index) -> Element? {
        let isValidIndex = (0 ..< count).contains(index)
        guard isValidIndex else {
            return nil
        }

        return self[index]
    }
}

let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherries", "Kiwifruit", "Orange", "Pineapple"]

let banana = fruits[safe: 2]
let pineapple = fruits[safe: 6]

// Does not crash, but contains nil
let invalid = fruits[safe: 7]
```


## #11 - Check whether a value is part of a given range
üí° Instead of writing `x >= 10 && x <= 100`, we can write `10 ... 100  ~=  x`.
#### Example:
```swift
let statusCode = 200

let isSuccessStatusCode = 200 ... 299 ~= statusCode
let isRedirectStatusCode = 300 ... 399 ~= statusCode
let isClientErrorStatusCode = 400 ... 499 ~= statusCode
let isServerErrorStatusCode = 500 ... 599 ~= statusCode
```

Another (more readable way) for checking whether a value is part of a given range can be achieved using the `contains` method:

```swift
let statusCode = 200

let isSuccessStatusCode = (200 ... 299).contains(statusCode)
let isRedirectStatusCode = (300 ... 399).contains(statusCode)
let isClientErrorStatusCode = (400 ... 499).contains(statusCode)
let isServerErrorStatusCode = (500 ... 599).contains(statusCode)
```

## #10 - Use `compactMap` to filter `nil` values
üéõ By using `compactMap` we can filter out `nil` values of a list. This can be useful, e.g. while parsing a server response:

```swift
struct ItemDataModel {
    let title: String?
}

struct ItemViewModel {
    let title: String
}

extension ItemViewModel {
    /// Convenience initializer, that maps the data-model from the server to our view-model
    /// if all required properties are available.
    init?(dataModel: ItemDataModel) {
        guard let title = dataModel.title else {
            return nil
        }

        self.init(title: title)
    }
}

class ListViewModel {
    /// ...

    func mapToItemViewModel(response: [ItemDataModel]) -> ([ItemViewModel]) {
        // Using `compactMap` we filter out invalid data-models automatically.
        return response.compactMap { ItemViewModel(dataModel: $0) }
    }
}
```


## #09 - Prefer `Set` instead of array for unordered lists without duplicates
üë´ **Advantage over `Array`:**

 - Constant Lookup time O(1), as a `Set` stores its members based on hash value.

**Disadvantage compared to `Array`:**

 - No guaranteed order.
 - Can't contain duplicate values.
 - All items we want to store must conform to `Hashable` protocol.

Please have a look at ["The power of sets in Swift" (by John Sundell)](https://medium.com/@johnsundell/the-power-of-sets-in-swift-57be8b223da0) for further examples and use-cases.


## #08 - Remove all sub-views from `UIView`
üì≠ - A small extension to remove all sub-views.

```swift
extension UIView {
    func removeAllSubviews() {
        subviews.forEach { $0.removeFromSuperview() }
    }
}
```


## #07 - Animate image change on `UIImageView`
‚úçÔ∏è Easily (ex)change an image with using a transition (note that the `.transitionCrossDissolve` is the key to this working).

```swift
extension UIImageView {
    func updateImageWithTransition(_ image: UIImage?, duration: TimeInterval) {
        UIView.transition(with: self, duration: duration, options: .transitionCrossDissolve, animations: { () -> Void in
            self.image = image
        })
    }
}
```


## #06 - Change `CALayer` without animation
üë®‚Äçüé® CALayer has a default implicit animation duration of [0.25 seconds](https://apple.co/2PVTCsB). Using the following extension we can do changes without an animation:

```swift
extension CALayer {
    class func performWithoutAnimation(_ actionsWithoutAnimation: () -> Void) {
        CATransaction.begin()
        CATransaction.setAnimationDuration(0.0)

        actionsWithoutAnimation()

        CATransaction.commit()
    }
}
```


## #05 - Override `layerClass` to reduce the total amount of layers
> By overriding 'layerClass' you can tell UIKit what CALayer class to use for a UIView's backing layer.
> That way you can reduce the amount of layers, and don't have to do any manual layout.
[John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell/status/1000099872580816897)

This can be archived with the following code:

```swift
override class var layerClass: AnyClass {
    return CAGradientLayer.self
}
```

This is e.g. useful to add a linear gradient behind an image. Furthermore we could change the gradient-color based on the time of the day, without having to add multiple images to our app.
![Example][overwrite-layer-class]

You can see the full code for the example in my gist for the [Vertical Gradient Image View](https://gist.github.com/fxm90/9604b0a067af46f68b80c6968736558d).

## #03 - Use `didSet` on outlets to setup components
üëè By using `didSet` on outlets, we can setup our view components (declared in a storyboard or xib) in a very readable way:

```swift
class FooBarViewController: UIViewController {

    // MARK: - Outlets

    @IBOutlet private var button: UIButton! {
        didSet {
            button.setTitle(viewModel.normalTitle, for: .normal)
            button.setTitle(viewModel.disabledTitle, for: .disabled)
        }
    }

    // MARK: - Private properties

    private var viewModel = FooBarViewModel()
}
```


## #02 - Most readable way to check whether an array contains a value (`isAny(of:)`)
‚ú® A small extension to check whether a value is part of e.g. an array, in a very readable way (by [John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell/status/943510426586959873))

```swift
extension Equatable {
    func isAny(of candidates: Self...) -> Bool {
        return candidates.contains(self)
    }
}
```

#### Example:
```swift
enum Product {
    case macBook
    case iPad
    case iPhone
    case watch
}

let device: Product = .iPhone

// Before
let isIOSDevice = [.iPad, .iPhone].contains(device)

// After
let isIOSDevice = device.isAny(of: .iPad, .iPhone)
```


## #01 - Override `self` in escaping closure, to get a strong reference to `self`
üö∏ To avoid retain cycles we often have to pass a `weak` reference to `self` into closures. By using the following pattern, we can get a strong reference to `self` for the lifetime of the closure.

```swift
someService.request() { [weak self] response in
    guard let self = self else { return }

    self.doSomething(with: response)
}
```

**Notice:** The above works as of Swift 4.2. Before you have to use:

```
guard let `self` = self else { return }
```
